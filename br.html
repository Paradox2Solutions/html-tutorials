          br tag:

          The HTML `<br>` tag is a self-closing element used to insert a line break within a block of text or content on a web page.
          
          Unlike paragraphs that create vertical spacing between blocks of text, the `<br>` tag creates a simple line break within the same block, moving the subsequent content to the next line.
          
          This tag is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to maintain content within the same context but need to display it on separate lines, such as addresses, poems, or short phrases.
          
          The `<br>` tag does not require a closing tag and is commonly used for maintaining formatting and legibility in cases where full paragraphs are not necessary.
