                      Footer tag:

                      The HTML <footer> tag is a container element used to define the footer section of a web page or a section within it.
                        
                      It's typically placed at the bottom of the page and contains content like copyright notices, contact information, related links, and other supplementary details.

                      The <footer> tag helps structure and organize the layout of a web page by encapsulating content that appears at the bottom of the page, often after the main content area.
                        
                      It's commonly used to provide context, attribution, and navigation options that are relevant to the entire page or a specific section.
                      -->
