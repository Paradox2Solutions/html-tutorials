                      Main tag:

                      The HTML <main> tag is a container element introduced in HTML5 that is used to define the main content area of a web page.
                        
                      It's intended to enclose the primary content that is directly related to the purpose of the page, excluding headers, footers, sidebars, and other peripheral content.

                      By using the <main> tag, web developers can provide semantic structure to their web pages, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to identify the main content area.
                        
                      This contributes to better accessibility and search engine optimization.
