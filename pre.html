                    Pre tag:

                    The HTML <pre> tag is a block-level element used to define a block of preformatted text.
                      
                    When you enclose content within the <pre> tag, the enclosed text is displayed exactly as it appears in the source code, including spaces, line breaks, and indentation.
                      
                    This is in contrast to the normal behavior of HTML, which collapses multiple spaces and ignores line breaks.
                    -->
