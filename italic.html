            Italic Tag:

            The HTML <i> tag, known as the "italic" tag, is an inline element used to apply emphasis to text by rendering it in italicized style.
              
            While the primary purpose of the <i> tag was to indicate that the enclosed text should be displayed in italics, its semantic meaning has evolved over time.
           -->


           <!-- Use case/ Example. -->
           <i> This is italic tag</i>
