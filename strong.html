              Strong tag:

              The HTML <strong> tag is an inline element used to indicate that the enclosed text should be displayed with strong importance or emphasis. 
              
              The primary purpose of the <strong> tag is to convey a higher level of significance to the content it wraps, rather than merely dictating a specific visual style.

              When used, the <strong> tag often results in text being displayed in bold font weight by default. However, the key distinction between the <strong> tag and the <b> tag (which also makes text bold) is the semantic meaning it carries.
                
              The <strong> tag communicates strong importance to both human readers and search engines, making it a better choice when emphasizing content for accessibility and SEO purposes.
