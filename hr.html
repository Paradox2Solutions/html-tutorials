           hr Tag:

           The HTML `<hr>` tag is a self-closing element used to create a horizontal rule or line within a web page's content.
           
           It serves to visually separate or demarcate sections of content, providing a clear visual break between different topics, divisions, or segments of information.
           
           The `<hr>` tag is particularly useful for enhancing readability and organization by creating a visible boundary, akin to a line on a printed page.
           
           While it traditionally represented a thematic shift, modern web design often uses CSS for styling and spacing, but the `<hr>` tag remains a straightforward way to add a visible line break when needed.
