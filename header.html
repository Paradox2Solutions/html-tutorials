                    Header tag:

                    The HTML <header> tag is a container element used to define the introductory or top section of a web page or a section within it.
                      
                    It typically contains elements like headings, logos, navigation menus, and other content that provide essential context and navigation options to users.

                    The <header> tag helps structure and organize the layout of a web page by encapsulating content that appears at the top of the page, often above the main content area.
                      
                    It's commonly used to display consistent branding elements across pages, such as a website's logo and navigation links.
