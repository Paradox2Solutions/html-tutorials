          Small Tag:

          The HTML <small> tag is an inline element used to indicate that the enclosed text should be presented in a smaller font size compared to the surrounding content.
            
          It's often used to display fine print, legal disclaimers, copyright notices, or any content that is of secondary importance or requires less visual emphasis.
          
          Overall, the <small> tag helps control the visual hierarchy of your content by reducing the font size for specific sections, enhancing readability and design flexibility.
