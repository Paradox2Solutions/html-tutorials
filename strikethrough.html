                    Strikethrough Tag:

                    The HTML <strike> tag (also known as the "strikethrough" tag) was historically used to create a visual strikethrough effect on enclosed text.
                      
                    However, it's important to note that the <strike> tag has been deprecated in HTML5, and its usage is no longer recommended.

                    Instead of using the <strike> tag, modern web design and development practice typically relies on CSS to achieve a strikethrough effect.
                   -->
