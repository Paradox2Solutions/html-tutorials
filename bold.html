              Bold Tag:

              The HTML <b> tag, known as the "bold" tag, is an inline element used to apply strong importance or emphasis to enclosed text.
                
              The primary purpose of the <b> tag is to make the text within it appear in a bold font weight, though its semantic meaning has evolved over time.

              In modern web development, the <b> tag is often used for stylistic purposes, rather than purely semantic ones.
