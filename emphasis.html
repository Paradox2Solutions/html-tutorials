            Emphasis tag:

            The HTML <em> tag, known as the "emphasis" tag, is an inline element used to indicate that the enclosed text should be displayed with emphasis.
              
            The default rendering style for text within the <em> tag is usually italicized, but the main purpose of the tag is to provide semantic meaning, rather than dictate a specific style.

            The <em> tag is used to convey that the text it wraps has a higher level of importance or should be emphasized for various reasons, such as emphasizing a key point, indicating stress, or highlighting a concept.
              
            It's not solely about the visual appearance; it carries meaning that can be beneficial for both accessibility and search engine optimization.
