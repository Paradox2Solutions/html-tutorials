                Delete Tag:

                The HTML <del> tag is an inline element used to indicate that a section of text has been deleted or removed from the document.
                  
                When you enclose content within the <del> tag, the enclosed text is often displayed with a strikethrough line, suggesting that it's no longer valid or relevant.

                The <del> tag is commonly used in scenarios where you want to show that content has been removed or deprecated, such as in document revisions, collaborative editing, or change logs.
                -->
