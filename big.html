            Big tax:
          
            The HTML <big> tag, although part of the HTML specification, is not widely supported in modern browsers and its usage is generally not recommended.
              
            The purpose of the <big> tag was to increase the font size of enclosed text, making it appear larger than the surrounding content.
              
            However, due to the lack of consistent support and better ways to style text, using CSS to control font sizes is now the preferred method in web development.

            In modern web design, styling text size is typically achieved through CSS properties like font-size, allowing for more precise control over text appearance and avoiding the potential inconsistencies associated with the <big> tag.
