          DL (Description List) Tag:

          The <dl> tag is used to create a description list, which consists of terms (defined terms) and their corresponding descriptions.
            
          Each term is enclosed in a <dt> tag (definition term), and its description is enclosed in a <dd> tag (definition description).
            
          Description lists are commonly used to present glossaries, definitions, or other paired information.
