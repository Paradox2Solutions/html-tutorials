                  Insert Tag:

                  The HTML <ins> tag is an inline element used to indicate that a section of text has been inserted or added into the document.
                    
                  When you enclose content within the <ins> tag, the enclosed text is often displayed with an underline or other formatting to signify that it's new or recently added.

                  The <ins> tag is typically used in scenarios where you want to highlight content that has been inserted, such as in document revisions, collaborative editing, or to show changes between different versions of content.
                  -->
