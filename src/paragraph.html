        Paragraph Tag:

        The HTML `<p>` (paragraph) tag is a fundamental element used to define and structure text content within a web page. 
            
        It represents a block of text that is typically separated from other content by vertical spacing, creating a clear visual distinction. 
        
        When the browser renders an HTML `<p>` tag, it automatically adds both top and bottom margins to ensure a readable layout. 
            
        This tag is commonly employed for organizing and presenting textual information, such as articles, descriptions, and other narrative content, within a structured hierarchy of a web document.
